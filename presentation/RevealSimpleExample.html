<h2>Using Reveal-dsd.js</h2>
<p>
Reveal-dsd.js is a modification by Dallin S. Durfee of Hakim El Hattab's reveal.js.  Thanks Hattab for an excellent piece of software!
<p>
These instructions are also an example presentation using Reveal-dsd.js.  It's not very long, because there is already 
a nice example presentation at the <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js</a> web page.
<p>
The first few slides will describe the changes I made to reveal.js.  The last slide gives basic instructions on how to use it.
</section>

<section>
<h2>Changes</h2>
The changes that I made to Hakim El Hattab's reveal.js script are listed on the next few slides.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Moved some of the code from the html file you generate into the js script file, so that you have to put less clutter into your
presentation file.</li>
<li>Changed the key for the slide sorter to "s."  The slide sorter can sometimes be slow to come up, and it was really irritating
for me to keep accidentally opening it because I'm used to hitting the space bar to advance a slide in a presentation.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Made the space bar and the "x" key move you forward/backward one slide or fragment - regardless of whether the next slide is
down or to the right.  By hitting the space bar you will go through the whole presentation without accidentally skipping anything.</li>
<li>Added a clickable area above the progress bar which allows you to quickly navigate to any point in your presentation</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Made is so that when you press the "z" key, it puts the current slide location into the url.  This makes it much easier to 
develop presentations - now when you reload the page it takes you to the slide you "marked" with the "z" key rather than the
beginning of the presentation.</li>
<li>Added quick navigation keys to help you thumb through the presentation faster - "f" and "b" move you a slide to the right or left
without stepping through fragments, and "u" and "d" move you up or down a slide without stepping through fragments.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added code so that the "enter" key reveals or hides all of the fragments on a slide.</li>
<li>Added code so that "home" and "end" take you to the beginning and ending slides of the presentation.</li> 
<li>Added a keyboard symbol to the navigation controls - clicking on it or pressing "h" will open a window with help on the controls.</li>
<li>Made a font for the navigation controls and modified the standard .css file to work with the changes</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Download <a href="reveal-dsd.zip">this zip file</a> with reveal-dsd.js, reset.css, reveal-dsd.css, DSDNavFontRegular.ttf, and the source for this presentation.  Then use the source for this presentation (RevealSimpleExample.html) as the basis for your new presentation.  See the <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js</a> page for more instructions.  
<p>
That's all you need to know - but note that some of the code in the example at <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js</a> isn't present in my example, because I moved it into the .js file.  Also, note that my modification of the .css file has some additional features described in the comments of the .js file.
